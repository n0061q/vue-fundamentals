# Vue fundamentals (Todo App)

This project was bootstrapped with `npm init vue@3` as described in https://vueschool.io/lessons/vue-fundamentals-capi-local-setup-with-vite

> This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

Using the template I implemented a simple Todo App (similar to one from the same course).


Another useful course is https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-3/intro-to-vue3

Code available at https://github.com/Code-Pop/Intro-to-Vue-3

That one is based on the Options API and does not include the build step.


## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
